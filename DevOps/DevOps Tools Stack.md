# DevOps Tools Stack

The DevOps lifecycle encompasses several phases, each with its specialized set of tools that facilitate seamless software development, deployment, and monitoring.

1.  **Plan**:
    
This phase involves outlining the project's objectives, scope, and tracking its progress. Tools in this phase help manage tasks, issues, and milestones.

   **Project Management & Tracking**: Jira, Asana, Targetprocess, Confluence, Pivotal Tracker, Redmine, Taiga, YouTrack, Trello.
   
   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Eclipse, Atom, Visual Studio.
   
2.  **Code**:
    
This is where the actual software is written. Version control tools help manage code versions and ensure collaborative coding without conflicts.

 **Version Control**: Git, Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub.
 
 **IDE**: Xcode.
 
3.  **Build**:
    
After coding, the software is compiled into executable artifacts. This phase ensures code integration and that the software is build-ready.
    
**Continuous Integration & Build Tools**: CircleCI, Jenkins, TeamCity, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Travis CI, Bamboo, codeship, bitrise, AWS CodeBuild, MS Build, Google Cloud Build.

**Build Automation Tools**: Gradle, SBT, Bazel, Maven.

4.  **Test**:
    
The software is rigorously tested for bugs, vulnerabilities, and functionality. Automated tools facilitate this process for accuracy and efficiency.

   **Automated Testing Tools**: Selenium, JUnit, Postman, CMake, TestRail, Robot Framework, SoapUI, ZEPHYR.
   
5.  **Release**:
    
   This phase involves preparing the software for deployment into a live environment. It ensures that the software is release-ready and can be rolled back if issues arise.
   
   **Continuous Deployment & Release Management**: Jenkins X, Spinnaker, Octopus Deploy, Electric Flow.
   
6.  **Deploy**:
    
   The software is deployed to a live environment, making it accessible to end-users. Deployment tools ensure smooth, consistent, and efficient rollouts.
   
 **Deployment & Containerization**: Google Cloud Deployment Manager, Heroku, flux, Rancher, AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, Ansible, Docker, Helm, CHEF, ArgoCD, Puppet, Kubernetes, NomaU.
 
7.  **Operate**:
    
   Once deployed, the software requires maintenance, updates, and potential fixes. This phase ensures software performance and stability post-deployment.
   
  **Monitoring & Performance**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, Zabbix, Splunk, ELK, Nagios, Datadog, Sensu, Icinga, Sysdig, graylog.
  
8.  **Monitor**:
    
   Continuous monitoring of the software is vital to detect and address issues proactively, ensuring optimal performance and user satisfaction.
   
 **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, Zabbix, Splunk, ELK, Nagios, Datadog, Sysdig.
