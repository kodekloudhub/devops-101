## DevOps

DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to streamline and automate the software development and deployment process. The primary goal of DevOps is to enable collaboration and communication between development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams to deliver software products and services more rapidly, reliably, and efficiently.
