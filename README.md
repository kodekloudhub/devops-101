## Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a part of the Linux Foundation. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is widely used in cloud-native and container-based application development.
